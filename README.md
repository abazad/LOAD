# LOAD

A small PHP and Bash based downloader that can retrieve files from the web and supports authenticated uploaded.net accounts.

I use this when I need to save a file from iOS, but don't need it right away. On my web server, a little stash accumulates.

The script supports saving to Dropbox directly, if you fill in a valid app id, with the saver url setting set to the domain you're running the script from.

*Disclaimer: This is not a very elaborate script, with only basic error checking and limited features. Feel free to extend it or correct it. I'd be happy to hear of your improvements. As a free and tiny side project though, I can't promise this will be updated.*
